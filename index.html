<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="fade-in">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am an Information Technology graduate with a strong interest in business systems,
    customer support, and practical technology solutions. During my academic training,
    I developed systems aimed at solving real-world problems, including an Inventory
    Management System for car spare parts and a Payroll Management System for employee
    salary processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also gained hands-on professional experience working in IT support at KALRO
    Kandara and in customer service and technical support at Consolidated Bank. These
    experiences strengthened my ability to work with users, handle operational systems,
    and support digital services in organizational environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    My career goal is to grow within the ICT field by contributing to efficient systems,
    reliable support services, and improved digital service delivery in business and
    financial institutions.
